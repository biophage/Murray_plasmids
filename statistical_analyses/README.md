# Statistical analyses

This directory contains the code used for the statistical analyses presented in our study.

* `Size_comparison.R`: Size differences between PAE and Modern plasmids of the same Close Family (Mixed-CF).
* `Size_comparison_Allplots`: Plots showing the distribution of plasmid size differences for all the 88 Mixed-CFs identified in the study.
* `Transposase_comparison.R`: Differences in number of transposases between PAE and Modern plasmids of the same Mixed-CF.
* `Virulence_comparison.R`: Differences in number of virulence factors between PAE and Modern plasmids of the same Mixed-CF.
* `mt.tsv`: Characteristics and metadata of PAE plasmids and their modern close relatives. Data source for the PAE vs Modern comparisons.
* `AMR_v_noAMR_mixed_CFs.R`: Size, transposase, virulence gene and core genome differences between Mixed-CFs containing (AMR) or lacking (No AMR) resistance plasmids.
* `Heatmap_annotations.tsv`:  Characteristics of Mixed-CFs. Data source for the AMR vs No AMR Mixed-CFs comparison.
