# Murray plasmids
## Genome analysis of pre-antibiotic era (PAE) plasmids of the Murray collection and their modern relatives
This is the repository for our study on the evolution of PAE plasmids and the origin of antimicrobial resistance vectors. Most PAE plasmids investigated in this study were assembled from genomes of bacterial pathogens from the Murray collection, isolated between 1917 and 1954.

Our study is available as a preprint:
