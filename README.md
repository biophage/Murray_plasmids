# Murray plasmids
## Genome analysis of pre-antibiotic era (PAE) plasmids of the Murray collection and their modern relatives
This is the repository for data related to our study on the evolution of PAE plasmids and the origin of antimicrobial resistance vectors. Most PAE plasmids investigated in this study were assembled from genomes of bacterial pathogens from the Murray collection, isolated by Prof. E.G.D. Murray worldwide between 1917 and 1954.

Our study is available as a preprint in BioRxiv:

Cazares, A. _et al._ "Pre and Post antibiotic epoch: insights into the historical spread of antimicrobial resistance". _BioRxiv_ (2024).

- Software and commands used to analyse the plasmid sequences are described in [analysis](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/analysis).
- R code and files used for the statistical analyses can be found in [statistical_analyses](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/statistical_analyses).
- R code used for plotting and visualisation is available in [plots_and_visualisation](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/plots_and_visualisation).

_A long-term compressed version of this repository, along with the assembled sequences of Murray plasmids and large network files, has been deposited in the following Zenodo archive:_
