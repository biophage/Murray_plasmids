# Statistical analyses

This directory contains plots (`Size_comparison_Allplots` sub-directory) showing the distribution of PAE and Modern plasmid size differences across the 57 Mixed-CFs identified from our hybrid assemblies data.

See the methods section of our paper for details and the main [statistical_analyses](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/statistical_analyses) directory for the code (`Size_comparison.R`) used to generate the plots.
