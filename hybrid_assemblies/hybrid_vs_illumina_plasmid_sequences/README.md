# Nucleotide-level comparison of plasmid sequences mined from Illumina and hybrid genome assemblies
This directory contains the _mummer (dnadiff)_ comparisons between plasmid sequences detected from the Illumina-only and hybrid (Illumina-ONT) genome assemblies of a subset of Murray strains. 

Each of the 65 sub-directories holds output plots of a different Murray strain. _Note that in some instances plasmids were not detected in the Illumina (n=29) or hybrid (n=24) assembly of a given strain; therefore, those strains are not listed here_.

All sub-directories contain the following files:

- A similarity dot plot coloured by nucleotide identity.
- An alignment coverage plot.

Across plots, plasmid sequences mined from the hybrid genome assemblies are laid out on the x-axis.
