# Murray hybrid assemblies

This is the directory for data related to the plasmids identified from Murray hybrid (Illumina-ONT) genome assemblies.

- Pairwise comparisons of PAE and modern plasmids of the same close family are available in [Mixed-CF_plasmid_pairwise_comparisons](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/hybrid_assemblies/Mixed-CF_plasmid_pairwise_comparisons).
- Comparison of plasmid sequences mined from Illumina-only and hybrid genome assemblies can be found in [hybrid_vs_illumina_plasmid_sequences](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/hybrid_assemblies/hybrid_vs_illumina_plasmid_sequences).
- Plots showing the distribution of PAE and modern plasmid size differences in Mixed-CFs can be found in [statistical_analyses](https://github.com/biophage/Murray_plasmids/tree/master/hybrid_assemblies/statistical_analyses).
